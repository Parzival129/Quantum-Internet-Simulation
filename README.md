# Quantum-Internet-Simulation
This is a experimental simulation of the operations of a quantum internet may work in the future.

In this project I simulated being able to send a simple string of text over a quantum network using the super dense coding protocol
in the QChat library. I also took it a step further and added the ability to be able to send an entire html file over this same protocol
though I will most likely continue working on this to allow for more efficent delivery speeds.

I programmed this by using the QChat library as well as the Simulaqron quantum network simulation for testing
